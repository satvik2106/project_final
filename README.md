 It is a web-based application that verifies cheque signatures against stored signatures using Deep Learning for enhanced security and accuracy. The system will leverage pre-trained deep learning models, fine-tuned for the task of signature verification, to ensure high accuracy and robustness. Users can upload images for signature verification. The system will preprocess image to extract the features.The extracted signature will be compared against stored signatures using a deep learning model, leveraging pre-trained architectures like VGG16 or ResNet.The system will return a verification result indicating whether the signature is genuine or forged. 
 
Signature Verification System Project Overview: The Signature Verification System is a web-based application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).   
Features User Authentication: Secure login and signup system for users. Signature Upload: Users can upload signatures for verification. 
Database Integration: Signature data and user information are stored in MongoDB.  
Learning Model: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for signature comparison (e.g., ResNet, VGG16). 
Frontend Interface: Built with REACT, providing a smooth user experience for signing up, logging in, and verifying signatures.

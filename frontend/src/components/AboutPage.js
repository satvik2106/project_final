            Signature verification is a process used to determine whether a
            signature on a document or transaction is authentic, typically by
            comparing it to a known reference signature. This process plays a
            critical role in security, fraud prevention, and identity verification,
            ensuring that the signer is authorized to act or sign documents.

          <h2 class="c">How Does Signature Verification Work?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Capture:</strong> The signature is first captured digitally, using scanners, tablets, or smartphones.</li>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The captured image is cleaned to remove any noise, distortions, or artifacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Unique features of the signature, such as stroke direction, speed, pressure, and pen angle, are extracted.</li>
            <li><strong>Reference Signature Creation:</strong> Multiple samples of the same personâ€™s signature are used to create a baseline for comparison.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> The extracted features of the signature being verified are compared with the reference signature using mathematical algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> A decision is made on whether the signature is genuine or forged, usually indicated by a confidence score.</li>
          </ul>
